# BEP
This GitHub is part of the Bachelor End Project regarding face detection and clustering models. In this code, all results can be checked and replicated (although that may not be recommended because of long run-times). Besides, the interactive visualization can be run using this code. For more information regarding the project, see the [thesis](https://github.com/stiverthijmen163/BEP/blob/main/Full_Thesis_BEP.pdf).

NOTE: need to download cmake (`cmake.org`) and restart pc in order to be able to download face_recognition

downloading news images from the internet takes quite a lot of time.

numpy==1.23.5 needed for embedding faces
